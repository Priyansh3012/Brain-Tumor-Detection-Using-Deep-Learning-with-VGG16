# Brain-Tumor-Detection-Using-Deep-Learning-with-VGG16
This project involves developing a deep learning model to classify MRI brain scan images into two categories: tumor and no tumor. By leveraging the VGG16 architecture, a pre-trained convolutional neural network, this project aims to automate the detection of brain tumors, providing an effective tool for aiding medical professionals in diagnosis.
